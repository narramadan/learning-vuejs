# Learning Vue.js - 2.x

This gitbook is for my personal scribble notes that I keep when I learn new technology. I generally use a notebook and bring it along with me for references. I am replacing the way I do with Gitbook as I see this more effective for writing my notes and referring them when needed.

Refer to the [Official Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) for more details and use this book for quick reference only...
