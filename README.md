# ![](/assets/vue.jpg)Learning Vue.js - 2.x

[Read the book](https://narramadan.gitbooks.io/learning-vue-js/)

This gitbook is for my personal scribble notes that I keep when I learn new technology. I generally use a notebook and bring it along with me for references. I am replacing the way I do with Gitbook as I see this more effective for writing my notes and referring them when needed. Refer to the [Official Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) for more details and use this book for quick reference only...

Definition from the official guide for Vue

> Vue\(pronounced /vjuÀê/, like **view **\) is a **progressive framework **for building user interfaces.

More on [Progressive Framework](/quick-intro.md#progressive-framework)

**Setting up development environment**

We will use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as our Package Manager and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as our Module Bundler. We use [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) to scaffold our project.

For all the above tools, we need to ensure that we have Node and NPM installed.

Download and Install Node.

* Verify if Node is working by running `node -v`
* Verify if NPM is working by running `npm -v`

Install Yarn by running `npm install -g yarn`

Install vue-cli by running `yarn global add vue-cli`
