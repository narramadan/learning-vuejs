# ![](/assets/vue.jpg)Learning Vue.js - 2.x

[Read the book](https://narramadan.gitbooks.io/learning-vue-js/)

This gitbook is for my personal scribble notes that I keep when I learn new technology. I generally use a notebook and bring it along with me for references. I am replacing the way I do with Gitbook as I see this more effective for writing my notes and referring them when needed. Refer to the [Official Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) for more details and use this book for quick reference only...

Definition from the official guide for Vue

> Vue\(pronounced /vjuÀê/, like **view **\) is a **progressive framework **for building user interfaces.
