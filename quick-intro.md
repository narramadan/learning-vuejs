# List of few Programming Paradigms

Below are few Programming Paradigms which are keep seeing whenever we drill down the web to look for different technologies. Listing them here for quick reference.

## [Functional Programming](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)

Functional programming is about writing pure functions, about removing hidden inputs and outputs as far as we can, so that as much of our code as possible just describes a relationship between inputs and outputs.

Using functions, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function. Calling a function twice with the same argument values will produce the same result.

## [Reactive Programming](https://medium.com/@kevalpatel2106/what-is-reactive-programming-da37c1611382)

Reactive programming is a Asynchronous Programming Paradigm around data flows and the propagation of change. This means that it should be possible to express static or dynamic data flows with ease in the programming languages used, and that the underlying execution model will automatically propagate changes through the data flow.

In MVC architecture, Reactive Programming can facilitate change in an underlying modal that automatically reflected in an associated view.

## [Functional Reactive Programming](http://blog.danlew.net/2017/07/27/an-introduction-to-functional-reactive-programming/)

It is a programming paradigm for Reactive Programming\(Asynchronous dataflow programming\) using the build block of Functional Programming\(ex: map, reduce, filter\)

## Declarative Programming

Declarative programming is when you write your code in such a way that it describes what you want to do, and not how you want to do it. It is left up to the compiler to figure out the how.

```js
const string = "Hello World"
const urlString = string.replace(/ /g, '-')

// string.replace -> this is declarative. We know what is being done
```

## Imperative Programming



# Frameworks

## Progressive Framework {#progressive-framework}

#### Quick intro on what is Progressive Framework

A Progressive Web App \(PWA\) uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user experience. They evolve from pages in browser tabs to immersive, top-level apps, maintaining the web's low friction at every moment.

#### Progressive Web Apps are

* **Progressive**
  * Work for every user, regardless of browser choice because they’re built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
* **Responsive**
  * Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
* **Connectivity independent**
  * Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.
* **App-like**
  * Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigations and interactions.
* **Fresh**
  * Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
* **Safe**
  * Served via TLS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn’t been tampered with.
* **Discoverable**
  * Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.
* **Re-engageable**
  * Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
* **Installable**
  * Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
* **Linkable**
  * Easily share via URL and not require complex installation
